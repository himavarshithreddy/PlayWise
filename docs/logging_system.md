```cpp
void History::add_played_song(const Song& song) {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    
    // Perform operation
    playbackHistory.push(song);
    
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto duration_us = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);
    
    std::string details = "Added song: " + song.getTitle() + " by " + song.getArtist();
    LOG_STACK_OP("ADD_PLAYED_SONG", details, playbackHistory.size(), duration_us);

```

### Priority Queue Operation Logging
```cpp
void FavoriteSongsQueue::updateListeningTime(const Song& song, int additionalSeconds) {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    
    // Perform operation
    std::string key = generateSongKey(song);
    songListeningTime[key] += additionalSeconds;
    rebuildQueue();
    
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto duration_us = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);
    
    std::string details = "Updated listening time for: " + song.getTitle() + " (+" + std::to_string(additionalSeconds) + "s)";
