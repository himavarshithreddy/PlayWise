  Addresses the need for efficient playlist management with bidirectional traversal, enabling complex operations like moving songs between positions, reversing playlists, and maintaining order with minimal memory overhead.

- **Data Structures Used**  
  Doubly Linked List with head and tail pointers, PlaylistNode structure containing Song object and prev/next pointers

- **Time and Space Complexity**  
  - add_song (end): O(1) time, O(1) space
  - add_song_at (position): O(n) time, O(1) space
  - delete_song (by index): O(n) time, O(1) space
  - move_song: O(n) time, O(1) space
  - reverse_playlist: O(n) time, O(1) space
  - display: O(n) time, O(1) space
  - Overall space complexity: O(n) where n is number of songs

- **Sample Input & Output**  
  ```
  Input: Add songs "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Hotel California", "Stairway to Heaven"
  Output: Playlist with 3 songs in order, bidirectional navigation possible
  ```

      PlaylistNode* next;
  };
  
  void add_song(const Song& song) {
      PlaylistNode* newNode = new PlaylistNode(song);
      if (tail == nullptr) {
          head = tail = newNode;
      } else {
          newNode->prev = tail;
          tail->next = newNode;
          tail = newNode;
      }
      size++;
  }
  ```

- **Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
  Memory management for dynamic node allocation was challenging. Solved by implementing proper destructor and copy constructor to prevent memory leaks.

**Feature:** Playback History (Stack)

- **Scenario Brief**  
  Implements an undo system for recently played songs, allowing users to revert their last played song and re-add it to the current playlist using LIFO principle.

- **Data Structures Used**  
  std::stack<Song> for LIFO operations, with configurable maximum size

- **Time and Space Complexity**  
  - add_played_song: O(1) time, O(1) space
  - undo_last_play: O(1) time, O(1) space
  - get_last_played: O(1) time, O(1) space
  - clear_history: O(n) time, O(1) space
  - Overall space complexity: O(n) where n is maximum history size

- **Sample Input & Output**  
  ```
  Input: Play songs A, B, C, then undo
  Output: Last played song C is removed from history and can be re-added
  ```

- **Code Snippet**  
  ```cpp
  void add_played_song(const Song& song) {
      if (playbackHistory.size() >= maxSize) {
          // Remove oldest song if at capacity
          std::stack<Song> temp;
          while (playbackHistory.size() > maxSize - 1) {
              temp.push(playbackHistory.top());
              playbackHistory.pop();
          }
          while (!temp.empty()) {
              playbackHistory.push(temp.top());
              temp.pop();
          }
      }
      playbackHistory.push(song);
  }
  ```

- **Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
  Managing stack size limits while maintaining LIFO order was tricky. Solved by implementing a size-checking mechanism that removes oldest entries when capacity is reached.

      RatingNode* right;
  };
  
  RatingNode* insertNode(RatingNode* node, int rating) {
      if (node == nullptr) {
          return new RatingNode(rating);
      }
      if (rating < node->rating) {
          node->left = insertNode(node->left, rating);
      } else if (rating > node->rating) {
          node->right = insertNode(node->right, rating);
      }
      return node;
  }
  ```

- **Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**

  ```cpp
  bool insert_song(const Song& song) {
      std::string songId = song.getId();
      if (songsById.find(songId) != songsById.end()) {
          return false; // Song already exists
      }
      songsById[songId] = song;
      titleToId[song.getTitle()] = songId;
      return true;
  }
  
  Song* search_by_id(const std::string& songId) {
      auto it = songsById.find(songId);
      return (it != songsById.end()) ? &(it->second) : nullptr;
  }
  ```

- **Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
  Maintaining consistency between ID and title mappings was challenging. Solved by implementing synchronized update operations that modify both maps simultaneously.

  Output: Sorted playlist by specified criteria (title, duration, etc.)
  ```

- **Code Snippet**  
  ```cpp
  static void mergeSort(std::vector<Song>& songs, SortCriteria criteria) {
      auto compare = getComparator(criteria);
      mergeSortHelper(songs, 0, songs.size() - 1, compare);
  }
  
  static std::function<bool(const Song&, const Song&)> getComparator(SortCriteria criteria) {
      switch (criteria) {
          case SortCriteria::TITLE_ASC:
              return [](const Song& a, const Song& b) { return a.getTitle() < b.getTitle(); };
          case SortCriteria::DURATION_ASC:
              return [](const Song& a, const Song& b) { return a.getDuration() < b.getDuration(); };
          // ... other criteria
      }
  }
  ```

      size_t memoryUsage;
  };
  
  void updateSystemStats() {
      stats.totalSongs = songDatabase->get_size();
      stats.averageRating = calculateAverageRating();
      stats.mostPlayedArtist = getMostPlayedArtist();
      // ... other statistics
  }
  ```

- **Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
  Aggregating data from multiple components while maintaining real-time accuracy was challenging. Solved by implementing efficient update mechanisms and caching strategies.
