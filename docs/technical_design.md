## 1. Song Class (Core Data Structure)

### Design
- **Purpose**: Represents a music track with all metadata
- **Data Members**: ID, title, artist, duration, rating, album, genre, added date
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for all operations
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) per song object

### Key Features

- Duration formatting (MM:SS)
- Comparison operators for sorting
- Validation methods
- Comprehensive display functionality

### Implementation Highlights
```cpp
class Song {
    std::string id, title, artist, album, genre, addedDate;
    int duration, rating;
    
    // Constructors, getters, setters
    // Comparison operators
    // Utility methods
};
```

## 2. Playlist Engine (Doubly Linked List)

### Design
- **Purpose**: Efficient playlist management with bidirectional traversal
- **Data Structure**: Doubly linked list with head and tail pointers
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Add song: O(1) at end, O(n) at specific position
  - Delete song: O(n) to find, O(1) to delete
  - Move song: O(n) to find both positions, O(1) to move
  - Reverse playlist: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is number of songs

### Key Operations
- `add_song()` - Add songs at end or specific position
- `delete_song()` - Remove songs by index or ID
- `move_song()` - Reorder songs within playlist
- `reverse_playlist()` - Reverse entire playlist order
- `shuffle()` - Randomize playlist order

### Implementation Highlights
```cpp
struct PlaylistNode {
    Song song;
    PlaylistNode* prev;
    PlaylistNode* next;
};

class Playlist {
    PlaylistNode* head, *tail;
    int size;
    std::string name;
};
```

    RatingNode* root;
    int totalSongs;
    
    void insert_song(const Song& song, int rating);
    std::vector<Song> search_by_rating(int rating);
    std::vector<Song> get_top_rated_songs(int count);
};
```

## 5. Song Database (HashMap)

### Design
- **Purpose**: O(1) average time song lookup by ID or title
- **Data Structure**: STL unordered_map with dual indexing
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insert song: O(1) average
  - Search by ID: O(1) average
  - Search by title: O(1) average

- Case-insensitive search
- Advanced search capabilities
- Performance monitoring
- Export/import functionality

### Implementation Highlights
```cpp
class SongDatabase {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Song> songsById;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> titleToId;
    
    Song* search_by_id(const std::string& songId);
    Song* search_by_title(const std::string& title);
    std::vector<Song> search_by_artist(const std::string& artist);
};
```

## 6. Sorting Module

### Design
- **Purpose**: Multiple sorting algorithms for different criteria
- **Algorithms**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
